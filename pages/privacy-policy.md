# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 31, 2024**

## Introduction

Civle ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our game.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Player Names**: If you achieve a score in the top 10, you may optionally provide a player name to appear on the leaderboard. Names are limited to 20 characters and are subject to content moderation.
- **Scores**: Your game scores are automatically submitted when you complete a challenge.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Game Scores**: Your scores are automatically recorded when you submit them.
- **Timestamps**: We record the time when you submit your score.
- **Screenshots**: If you achieve the highest score (rank #1), a screenshot of your game board may be automatically saved and displayed as "Yesterday's Best Setup".

### Local Storage

The game uses browser local storage to:
- Track whether you have already submitted a score for the current day
- Remember your game preferences and settings

This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers except when you submit a score.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Leaderboard Display**: Player names and scores are displayed on the public leaderboard for the current day.
- **Historical Records**: Yesterday's top score and screenshot may be displayed as "Yesterday's Best Setup".
- **Game Functionality**: Scores are used to rank players and determine leaderboard positions.

## Data Storage and Retention

- **Score Files**: Score data is stored in JSON files on our servers. Score files are automatically deleted after 2 days (only today's and yesterday's scores are retained).
- **Screenshots**: Screenshot files are automatically deleted after 2 days (only today's and yesterday's screenshots are retained).
- **Leaderboard**: Only the top 100 scores per day are retained.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your player name and score may be visible to other players on the public leaderboard.

## Content Moderation

Player names are automatically checked against a list of inappropriate words. Names containing inappropriate content will be rejected.

## Your Rights

- **Name Submission**: Providing a player name is optional. You can choose to submit scores anonymously.
- **Name Uniqueness**: Each player name can only be used once per day. If a name is already taken, you must choose a different name.
- **Data Access**: You can view the current leaderboard at any time, which shows all top 10 scores with names.

## Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

Our game is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.
